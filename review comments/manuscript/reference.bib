  abstract = {<p>We present a path selection algorithm that is used when deploying
	hard real-time traffic flows onto a chip- multiprocessor system.
	This chip-multiprocessor system uses a priority-based real-time network-on-chip
	interconnect between the multiple processors. The problem we address
	is the following: given a mapping of the tasks onto a chip-multiprocessor
	system, we need to determine the paths that the traffic flows take
	such that the flows meet there deadlines. Furthermore, we must ensure
	that the deadline is met even in the presence of direct and indirect
	interference from other flows sharing network links on the path.
	To achieve this, our algorithm utilizes a link-level analysis to
	determine the impact of a link being used by a flow, and its affect
	on other flows sharing the link. Our experimental results show that
	we can improve schedulability by about 8\% and 15\% over Minimum
	Interference Routing and Widest Shortest Path algorithms, respectively.</p>},
